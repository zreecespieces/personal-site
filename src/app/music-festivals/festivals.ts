      "I was at the infamous Bonnaroo in 2025 where it was cancelled after a single day of heavy rain, only one day into the start of the festival. Luckily I had early entry on Tuesday so at least I got a couple days of camping, and met some great new friends. We all pitched in on an Airbnb in Nashville and still made the best out of the weekend - for my second time after the cancellation in 2021.",

Their latest album is probably my top EDM album of all time and it was an incredibly experience getting to see it live with such a big production. I went to both nights at Red Rocks along with the hangover set at Mission Ballroom.",
